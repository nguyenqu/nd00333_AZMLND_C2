# Operationalizing Machine Learning

*TODO:* Write an overview to your project.<br>

This project consists of two parts:<br>
1. The first part consists of creating a production machine learning model using AutoML in Azure Machine Learning Studio, and then deploying the best model and consuming 
it using the Swagger UI using the REST API endpoint and the key created for the deployed model.<br>
2. The second part of the project follows the same steps, but this time Azure Python SDK is used to create, train, and publish a pipeline with Jupyter Notebook. 
The whole procedure is explained in this README file and the result is demonstrated in the screencast video.<br>

For both parts of the project, I use the dataset available here, which contains marketing data about people. 
The data refer to direct marketing campaigns by a Portuguese banking institution. 
The classification objective is to predict whether the customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit. 
The result of the prediction appears in column **_y_** and it's either **_yes_** or **_no_**.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step.

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps. 
### Step 1: Authentication
I am using the provided lab Udacity to complete this project. 
So I skipped this step because I don't have permission to create a security principal.

### Step 2: Automated ML Experiment

### Step 3: Deploy the Best Model

### Step 4: Enable Logging

### Step 5: Swagger Documentation

### Step 6: Consume Model Endpoints

### Step 7: Create and Publish a Pipeline


*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
